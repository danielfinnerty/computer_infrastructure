by: Daniel Finnerty

## Introduction

This project provides a clear demonstration of the learnings gained both from the computer infrastructure module, and additional research performed to suplement these learnings. This is achieved through the use of the  following Python packages.

- yfinance
- pandas
- numpy
- datetime

The code, results, continued code explanations and information resources can be found in problems.ipynb.

## Running the Notebook locally
The notebook can be ran locally however, prior to do this the repository will need to be cloned to your local machine through the following steps:

### Using cmder

1. Download and install full version of cmder from:  
https://cmder.app/ 

2. In cmder, clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/danielfinnerty/computer_infrastructure.git
```

3. On your local machine, set new repository as directory

4. Configure git pull rebase

```
git config pull.rebase false
```

5. Open repository

```
python -m notebook
